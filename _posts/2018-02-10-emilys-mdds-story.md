What caused my MdDS? Not a cruise. Not a windy drive. It was a medication given to me while I was under anesthesia having an operation. I was put under general anesthesia to remove a kidney stone that had been lodged in my right ureter for three and a half months. A pretty routine procedure, it went just fine.
<pre>Except I woke up, and life has never been the same.</pre>
I am thirty years old, and I used to have dreams of summiting Mt. Everest and traveling the world. Now it’s an accomplishment if I can run more than one errand in a day. I have three small children, ages 7, 5, and 1, and a wonderful husband. But the MdDS spills over into the lives of the ones we love, doesn’t it? It’s an untruth to say otherwise. I have a full time job, also.

I should also say that I am a Christian, and while most days I do feel hopeless (just being honest), I try to center myself in Scripture and in Christ. This is a nasty fight we fight and for many of us, it is an invisible one fought at home. I take comfort in Psalm 62:8, “Trust in Him at all times, you people; pour out your hearts to Him, for He is our refuge.”
