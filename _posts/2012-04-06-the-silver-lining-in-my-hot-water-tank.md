<a href="http://www.igive.com/welcome/warmwelcome.cfm?c=43596"><img class="alignleft" style="border: 0 none;" src="http://www.igive.com/causetoolbox/assets/images/doyou234x.gif" alt="iGive.com" width="234" height="60" /></a>About a month ago, I went downstairs to wash the laundry, only to discover that the hot water tank had sprung a leak. A very bad leak. Water was gushing out like someone had opened up a faucet. So instead of doing the laundry (darn!), I started shopping for a new water heater.

I'd completely forgotten that I'd registered with iGive, but as soon as I went to HomeDepot.com, a little popup showed up to tell me that 1.2% of my purchase would be donated to the MdDS Balance Disorder Foundation. That might seem like a small donation, but since I ended up replacing the broken tank with an expensive tankless water heater, the Home Depot made a donation on my behalf in the amount of $12.

So in addition to not having to do the laundry, I found a $12 silver lining in my broken hot water tank.

There are over a thousand online retailers linked to iGive, providing donations ranging from 0.4% to as high as 30%. And not only is registering with iGive free, <strong>you can receive up to a $10 bonus thanks to their <a title="One Million iGive Buttons for Change" href="http://mddsfoundation.wordpress.com/2012/04/06/the-silver-lining-in-my-hot-water-tank/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">One Million Buttons for Change</a> promotion going on now</strong>!
