Cause bracelets have been available for breast cancer and heart disease but there has never been a unifying symbol, color or bracelet that represents the rare and genetic disease community.  That’s why the Global Genes Project started the 7,000 Bracelets for Hope™ campaign.

They collect unique bracelets made by jewelry designers, artists, crafters, church groups, girl scout troops and other volunteers and then distribute them to families fighting rare and genetic diseases. Adults receive handcrafted bracelets made by  jewelry designers while children receive friendship bracelets filled with hope. We encourage you to Wear that You Care and participate in the 7,000 Bracelets for Hope™ campaign. <a title="7,000 Bracelets for Hope™" href="http://globalgenes.org/7000-bracelets-for-hope/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Contribute or request a bracelet today</a>. They also give us hope through social-sharing of our stories of hope.

For her interview with the Global Genes Project, Deb Russo is wearing a special hat that features a blue fabric flower made by <a title="Gibson Girls Productions on Facebook" href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Gibson-Girls-Productions/260196824018434" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gibson Girls Productions</a>, supporter of several fundraising and awareness events for the MdDS Foundation. They've donated event planning time and silent auction items for <em>Catch the Chocolate Wave</em> in 2010, a wine tasting event and an Open House fundraiser, both in 2011. This year they're providing raffle prizes for our annual awareness walk in Colorado. If you're attending the Colorado <em>Rock'n Stroll</em>, you could win a hat like the one Deb's wearing. When you <a title="Register for the 2012 MdDS Walk" href="http://walk4mdds.eventsbot.com">register for the walk</a>, you'll automatically be entered to win and Wear That You Care.* The Gibson Girls is owned by Tracine Gibson, whose daughter, Keely, is the talented young lady that created the <a title="JAM: Life Vest Awareness Mailer" href="http://mddsfoundation.wordpress.com/2012/06/04/jam-life-vest-awareness-mailer/">Life Jacket</a> awareness piece.
