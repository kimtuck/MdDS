<a href="http://www.rarediseaseday.org/"><img class="alignleft" title="Rare Disease Day logo" src="http://img.rarediseaseday.org/RDD_2011/downloads/RDD_white_lg.jpg" alt="" width="122" height="117" /></a> Yesterday, I sent a request to Governor John Hickenlooper, to declare February 29, 2012 as Rare Disease Day in <a href="https://www.colorado.gov/governor/request-letter-proclamation-or-flag" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Colorado</a>. Getting your governor's proclamation is important because it raises awareness about orphan disorders like ours. It was actually pretty easy, but it would've been even easier if I'd known a couple of things beforehand. Today, I hope to help you with your request.

1) Below is a select list of governor's web sites. Use Google or <a title="GoodSearch" href="http://www.goodsearch.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GoodSearch</a> to find your state governor's web site if not listed here. There you will find the mailing address and contact numbers. This is the best way to submit a formal request. <a title="Rare Disease Day Proclamation Request" href="http://mddsfoundation.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/rdd-governor-letter-2012.doc">Here is a downloadable letter that you can customize and mail</a>.

2) On the "Contact the Governor" web page, search for a "Proclamations" link where you can submit your request online. Copy and paste the language from link below, as they probably will not let you submit the letter as an attachment. They also may ask for some information, such as:
<ul>
 	<li>Information about the requesting organization. I typed in: The MdDS Balance Disorder Foundation is dedicated to promoting education and research on Mal de Débarquement Syndrome (MdDS). We are an all-volunteer 501(c)3 nonprofit dedicated to promoting awareness of MdDS and to seeking treatments and a cure for people suffering from this rare disorder in Colorado [insert your state] and around the globe. www.mddsfoundation.org</li>
 	<li>Purpose of Proclamation. To raise awareness about rare diseases such as Mal de Débarquement Syndrome among citizens of [Your State].</li>
 	<li>Draft Language for the Proclamation. <a title="Sample Rare Disease Day Proclamation Wording" href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CCAQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Frarediseaseday.us%2Ffiles%2FRDD-sample-proclamation.doc&amp;ei=0SAPT7inM-mfiQKbs4jaDQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNFxexB4xzytkEC-TcwOIELHjK4i4g&amp;sig2=mrfn_i2RSQagHL50gnot5w">Here is a downloadable document with sample language</a>, provided by NORD/EURORDIS (National Organization for Rare Disorders and Rare Diseases Europe).</li>

<strong>Rare Disease Day</strong> was first observed in Europe in 2008. It was established by <a href="http://eurordis.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EURORDIS</a>, the European Rare Disease Organization. In 2009, EURORDIS asked <a href="http://rarediseases.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NORD</a> to be its partner in this initiative and to sponsor Rare Disease Day in the United States. Now, the concept is rippling out around the world. In 2011, over 60 countries participated.
Each year, World Rare Disease Day will be observed on the last day of February (Feb. 29 in leap years and Feb. 28 in other years). Our goal is to draw attention to rare diseases as an important public health issue that cannot be ignored.
