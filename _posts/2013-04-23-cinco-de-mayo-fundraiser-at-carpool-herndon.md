<strong>Help David make the Cinco de Mayo match and cheer him on as he goes for a Guinness World Record!</strong>

David M, a support member, is hosting a Cinco de Mayo fundraiser to support the MdDS Balance Disorder Foundation. David was able to secure a $1,000.00 donation from Patron Tequila -- as a Matching Challenge -- for this event. This is FANTASTIC, and I know we can meet this challenge. All we need to do is raise $1,000 dollars in donations by Cinco de Mayo - that's Sunday, May 5 - and Patron will match it. David has a site to take donations today at cdm-carpool.eventsbot.com

The fundraiser will be held at Carpool in Herndon, VA, where David will be trying to <a title="See an example of what he'll be attempting on YouTube." href="http://youtu.be/LR867dOuZbw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">break a Guinness World Record</a>! So if you are in the area and can attend this event, definitely stop by. There will be a Patron Margarita Domino Bomb Shot demonstration, food and drink specials all day, a silent raffle and t-shirt sale.

If you're not in the Herndon area, you can still help David make the match - click on either logo below to get to his event donation site.
