MAY 15: The survey is now closed.

<span style="text-decoration: line-through;">In an effort to collect current data, a new survey is underway. This survey closes in two weeks, so if you have or suspect that you have MdDS don't delay — complete the survey.</span> We hope to collect enough data to analyze, and to include key information in the June newsletter. The newsletter is distributed to many medical professionals and to the general public as well.<small></small>

The more people who complete the survey the more accurate the data will be. To ensure your data is included, you must complete the survey by May 15, 2014. All information will be coded to preserve participant anonymity and will be reported in aggregate form.

Thank you.
