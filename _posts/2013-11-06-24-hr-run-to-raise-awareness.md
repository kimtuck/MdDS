December 7–8, Doug, an MdDSer since March of 2013, will run a <a title="24-hour run" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24-hour_run" target="_blank" rel="noopener">24-hour ultra­marathon</a> to raise awareness of MdDS.

Doug has completed over 30 ultra­m­arathons but he says, "Since developing MdDS it has been a challenge to train like I should. I consider myself blessed to be able to function at work and continue running.

I KNOW what a challenge it is to live with this," he adds.
