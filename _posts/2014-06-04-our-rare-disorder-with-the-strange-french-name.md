June is MdDS Awareness Month, so the Foundation and its volunteers have been working doubly hard to spread awareness of Mal de Débarquement Syndrome. Our rare disorder with the strange French name is now recognized by organizations such as the <a title="National Institutes of Health" href="http://www.nih.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NIH</a>, <a title="National Organization for Rare Disorders" href="https://www.rarediseases.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NORD</a> and, just recently, the <a title="Rare Disease United Foundation" href="www.rarediseaseunited.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rare Disease United Foundation</a>. But we need to work even harder so that the general public recognizes it, too.

We've been posting daily on Twitter and Facebook to reach as wide an audience as possible. If you've missed our daily updates, you can catch up by clicking on either icon below.
