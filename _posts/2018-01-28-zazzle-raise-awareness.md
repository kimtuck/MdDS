To help you, we set up a store on Zazzle. From tees to mugs, there are many <a href="http://www.zazzle.com/mddsfoundation?rf=238617487973604920" rel="nofollow">items</a> to raise awareness of MdDS – and you can customize them all!

The purpose of the store is to raise awareness and help people who are battling Mal de Débarquement Syndrome, and those who have no idea of their illness. Through increased awareness, we hope to fuel additional <a href="https://mddsfoundation.org/research/">research</a>, to raise additional funds, and to ultimately find the cure for MdDS.

While we really like the MdDS Warrior items for Rare Disease Day, new products are continually being added to raise awareness throughout the year. Shop often!

If you don't see the item you want with the image you want, simply use the "Contact Store Owner" link on the <a href="http://www.zazzle.com/mddsfoundation?rf=238617487973604920">store's home page</a> and request a product. Our volunteers will be happy to try to make it, with no obligation to purchase.

Be sure to check <a href="https://www.zazzle.com/coupons">zazzle.com/coupons</a> for promotional discounts of up to 60% off. A small portion of each sale will still be sent to the MdDS Foundation as a donation on your behalf.

After you receive your items, please raise awareness by taking a photo and sharing on social media. A few great hashtags are #MdDSwarrior, #MdDSWarriors and #beatMdDS. And don't forget to tag us! You'll find us on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/mddsfoundation/">Instagram</a> and <a href="https://www.twitter.com/mddsfoundation/">Twitter</a> as @mddsfoundation, and on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/mddsfoundation.org/">Facebook</a> as @mddsfoundation.org.

<h3>How Rare is Mal de Debarquement Syndrome?</h3>
Any disease, disorder, illness or condition affecting fewer than 200,000 people in the United States is considered rare by the National Institutes of Health (<a href="https://www.nih.gov/">NIH</a>), the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the National Organization for Rare Disorders (<a href="https://rarediseases.org/">NORD</a>). There are currently approximately 7,000 rare diseases listed by the NIH.

The true incidence rate of MdDS is unknown but as of October 2018 our support group membership is just over 3,000. Many sufferers are undiagnosed or have been misdiagnosed. Our <a href="https://mddsfoundation.org/about-the-foundation/">mission</a> is to change that and better understand the true nature of Mal de Débarquement Syndrome.
