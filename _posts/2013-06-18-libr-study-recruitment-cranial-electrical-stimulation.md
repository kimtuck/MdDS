Cranial Electrical Stimulation for Mal de Débarquement Syndrome</p>
A LIBR research study is investigating the use of Cranial Electrical Stimulation (CES) for the treatment of Mal de Débarquement Syndrome (MdDS), a disorder characterized by chronic rocking dizziness which usually follows prolonged exposure to passive motion such as on a boat, airplane, or car. Some people may develop the disorder spontaneously. The study is recruiting patients with MdDS ages 18 years and older. CES is a noninvasive form of brain stimulation using electrical stimulation of the scalp that can be either with either direct or alternating current.
<div>Eligibility includes:</div>
<div>• No metal implanted in the head, except for dental fillings.</div>
<div>• No serious medical illness</div>
<div>• No history of mania or psychosis</div>
<div>• No skin disorder causing wounds on the scalp.</div>
<div>• Not currently pregnant</div>
Participation will require undergoing a brief screening interview over the telephone to assess safety for CES. If qualified to enter the study, study procedures will involve being randomized to either real or sham CES, depending on the phase of the study being entered. Qualification for participation in each part of the study will be determined by the investigator. Compensation is offered for portions of the study.
