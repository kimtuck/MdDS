Itâ€™s an orange life vest and when folded for mailing, the sticker to close it would be the buckle of the vest. Pretty clever, don't you think?

It is such a great piece because not only does it show that <em>someone gets it</em> but also because she designed the piece as a gift to her aunt, board member TerriG. When Keeley presented her project, none of her classmates had heard of MdDS but they became aware of it as she told them <a title="TerriG on Great Day Houston" href="http://youtu.be/eglbhkrbRRg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Terri's story</a>. With June Awareness Month just getting underway, her timing couldn't have been any better.

As JAM progresses, we look forward to sharing more stories like this with you.
