<p align="center"><strong>MdDS Clinical Research Study</strong></p>
Yoon-Hee Cha, MD, has been awarded a three year grant by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to conduct clinical studies on Mal de Debarquement Syndrome (MdDS). Beginning January 2010, Dr. Cha will receive funding from the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders (NIDCD), a NIH institute that supports research on disorders of balance.

The award to Dr. Cha (<em><a href="http://grantome.com/grant/NIH/R03-DC010451-01">Functional Neuroimaging and Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation in Mal de Debarquement</a>)</em> represents the inaugural use of US federal research dollars to investigate the cause and potential treatment of MdDS.

Some of Dr. Cha’s findings can be found <a title="PubMed NIHPA Manuscripts" href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2846419/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">online</a> on the National Center for Biotechnology Information website.
