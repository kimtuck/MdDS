Exciting news! We just met the $2-for-$1, $50,000 Matching Donation Challenge and now we want to express our appreciation to the anonymous donors who made this challenge a reality.

Since August, the Foundation Board and everyone in the Yahoo! Support Group, MdDS Facebook Friends group, and families and friends, worked hard to meet the match and raise funds for MdDS research. It is uplifting to read the posts regarding commitments (both personal time and donations) to the identification of the cause and the cure for our dreaded disorder. Meeting the challenge will enable vital MdDS research to continue.

Thanks to everyone’s efforts,<em> especially the anonymous donors’</em>, continued research will solve the mysteries of MdDS.

Please take a minute to leave a message of thanks to the anonymous donors who made this challenge come to life!
