Thanks to all the generous supporters to our matching donation challenge we really ended with a BIG BANG. Not only did you meet the $500 challenge, you surpassed it by $455! That means that $955 was contributed to our foundation by you to MAKE THE MATCH, for a total of $1,455 contributed to the MdDS Balance Disorder Foundation!

Congratulations to all and thank you to all who contributed!
