I have been suffering from MdDS since I was a child. It has got gradually worse as I got older. When I step out of an elevator I feel I am bouncing up and down inside for days after. It is very erratic especially when trying to sleep. If I step onto something wobbly, I will feel it for sometime afterwards.

Travelling on buses and in cars affects me, too. I feel like I am on a boat wobbling about inside my body.
Most people including doctors have never heard of MdDS.
Nothing seems to alleviate the bouncing. The more the wobble or movement of something, the worse and longer duration of the bouncing inside me is.
I feel like my whole body is bouncing about erratically like a <a href="https://mddsfoundation.org/2016/10/15/a-journey-to-mdds-land/#pinball">
pinball</a> machine.

It affects which jobs I can do; it also prevents me from living a full normal life.
Even trying to enjoy sex is affected.

Man has been to the moon and back, technology has come on leaps and bounds, but there's no sign of a cure for MdDS.
<h4>MdDS is invisible to everyone, it can't be seen or noticed by others. But I hope other sufferers of MdDS read this and know they're not alone.</h4>
All the best everyone,
Jim
