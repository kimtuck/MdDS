Things people need to know about those suffering from MdDS/MAV/chronic dizziness. By Abby Lane Pankey

1.) We aren't ignoring or not listening to you, it's just we are more worried about falling over than what you have to say.
2.) Trust me I am just as sick of being dizzy as you are of me complaining about being dizzy.
3.) Me putting on makeup and brushing my hair is the equivalent of you running a marathon.
4.) You telling me you have had vertigo before, and you know how it feels, could possibly get you punched in the throat.
5.) Your boat does not impress me, I've been living on one mentally for a while now.
6.) The chances of me running out of the grocery store are extremely high.
7.) If your house has 10 different patterns and is painted a bright color, we cant be friends.
8.) If you keep talking after I tell you I have head pressure, we can't be friends.
9.) Falling off the toilet is not that bad.
10.) Panic attacks are a way of life.
11.) I know more about my illness than most doctors.
12.) People who work with this should get paid double what they make.
13.) If I ever do get better the first people I am thanking are those online, that have never doubted my symptoms, who were always there, whom I love.
