The MdDS Foundation sincerely thanks all the supporters and volunteers that helped make this a successful year. Without you, these accomplishments would not be possible. Please take a few minutes to read these highlights.

<h3><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Top Media Moments</strong></span></h3>

<h2><strong><span style="color: #333399;">Research Report</span></strong></h2>
In addition to experimental treatment taking place at Mt. Sinai, we are extremely fortunate to have a variety of research efforts taking place at Ohio University, Deakin University and the Laureate Institute for Brain Research (LIBR). Some of the research is supported by a <a title="Our Directed Donations Policy" href="https://mddsfoundation.org/our-policies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Directed Donation</a>; an anonymous donor requested that the monies they provided be restricted to research being conducted by Dr. YH Cha, currently at LIBR.

In 2014, the Foundation provided over $70,000 to support research into the cause and cure for MdDS. With the help of our many supporters and their donations, the Foundation will be providing another $90,000 toward research in 2015.

<a title="Biomedical Literature" href="https://mddsfoundation.org/biomedical-literature/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>5 Research Papers Published</strong></a> in 2014, including <em><a title="The relationship between symptom severity, stigma, illness intrusiveness and depression in Mal de Debarquement Syndrome" href="http://hpq.sagepub.com/content/early/2014/10/16/1359105314553046.abstract?rss=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The relationship between symptom severity, stigma, illness intrusiveness and depression in Mal de Debarquement Syndrome</a></em>, a collaboration between US and UK doctors YH Cha and C. Dancey, <em>et al</em>.
<span style="font-family: Arial;"><small>
As you can see, past donations have allowed the Foundation to support research, awareness, and advocacy events. As 2014 comes to a close, please consider a tax deductible donation to the MdDS Balance Disorder Foundation. It is easy to donate at <a title="Donate" href="https://mddsfoundation.org/donate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">www.mddsfoundation.org/donate/</a></small></span>

The Foundation reads each and every message posted in its two Support Groups, made up of both men and women. Discussion and support is robust each day. Since its inception, 82,473 messages have been posted in the private Yahoo site alone. Each and every one has been read — more than 6,000 messages in 2014 — by the Foundation to ensure that members are receiving valuable insight and critical information.<span style="font-family: Arial;"> <small> <a title="Learn More About Our Support Groups" href="http://www.mddsfoundation.org/symptoms-scale/coping-with-mdds/support-groups/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Learn More About Our Support Groups</a></small></span>

<strong>The Foundation also celebrates</strong> the 10-year anniversary of being listed in the World Health Organization (WHO)'s International Classification of Diseases. <strong>Donna Hall</strong>, a dedicated volunteer, worked with <strong>Roger Josselyn</strong> and achieved this goal in 2004. The U.S. uses a <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/icd/icd10cm.htm">Clinical Modification</a> (ICD-10-CM) for medical diagnoses, and Mal de Débarqement Syndrome can be found under <a title="2015 ICD-10-CM Diagnosis Code R42" href="http://www.icd10data.com/ICD10CM/Codes/R00-R99/R40-R46/R42-/R42" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ICD-10-CM Diagnosis Code R42</a>. The International Classification of Diseases, 10th Edition, Clinical Modification/Procedure Coding System (ICD-10-CM/PCS) has been translated into 43 languages and is used by 117 countries.<sup><a href="http://www.who.int/classifications/icd/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1</a></sup><span style="font-family: Arial;"> <small> <a title="Learn More of Our History" href="http://www.mddsfoundation.org/marilyn-josselyns-mdds-story/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Learn More of Our History</a></small></span>
