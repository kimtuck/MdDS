<small>ANNOUNCEMENT</small>: Two of the Foundation's regular supporters have thrown down a Winter Warm-Up Challenge. Together they will match every dollar donated, dollar-for-dollar up to $1,000!

Donations fund vital research into the cause of and a cure for Mal de Débarquement Syndrome. One result of this research is that current medical information about MdDS is being generated, and this in turn raises awareness of our rare disorder.

<strong>The Winter Warm-Up Challenge funds must be raised by January 20, 2014</strong>, so please donate today and help us move the mercury. Use the PayPal button below or <a style="line-height: 1.5;" title="donate online or by check" href="http://www.mddsfoundation.org/donate" target="_blank" rel="noopener">click here</a> for other options.
