NEW FUNDRAISERS: Our Support Group members continue to give back to the Foundation through <em>new</em> fundraisers. Our Scentsy Consultant, Heidi Campbell, is generously donating 10% of net proceeds each month. And our Mary Kay Consultants, Joy Debes and Debbie Vecheck, have increased their donation to 30% each month. Please be a part of the change and shop their online stores today, by clicking on their ribbons.
