Independently organized by our fantastic volunteers in Harrisburg, the walk is set for September 27. It's a leisurely 3K route, and the trails at beautiful Shank Park are stroller- and dog-friendly.

<strong>It's a Cyberwalk, too!</strong> As always, the Walk is virtual and you can join us as a cyberwalker <em>wherever</em> you happen to be on September 27. If you need to walk on a different date, that works, too. We'll just say you're kicking off the 2014 Walk Series if you're walking sooner, or extending the series if you're walking later!
