Join me and start using <a title="GoodSearch" href="http://www.goodsearch.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GoodSearch</a> as your search engine, and they'll donate about a penny to your favorite cause every time you do a web search. I don't know about you, but I spend an inordinate amount of time searching the Internet for anything on Mal de Debarquement Syndrome. Search terms include Disembarkment Syndrome, Disembarcation Sickness, Persistent MDD, and on and on. Sometimes I feel like I've read all the stories there are, and sometimes a new one will pop up. Either way, a penny is raised with every search.Â <a title="Register Using Your Social Network" href="https://www.goodsearch.com/Registration.aspx?WMode=MAIN" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Registering is super-easy, since you can use your existing Facebook, Google, </strong></a><a title="Register Using Your Social Network" href="https://www.goodsearch.com/Registration.aspx?WMode=MAIN" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Yahoo! or Twitter profile</strong></a>.</p>
You can also shop through their online shopping mall, <a href="https://www.goodsearch.com/goodshop">GoodShop.com</a>, where there are more than 2,500 top online retailers, and a percentage of your purchases will go to the charity or school of your choice. You pay the same price as you normally would, but a donation on your behalf goes to your cause.
