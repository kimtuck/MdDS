In case you are not familiar, a friendraiser is an event hosted by a foundation or its board members to cultivate donors by having current supporters bring a friend. The event is typically a closed, private party with good drink, good food, and even entertainment.

<strong>But we're not typical, are we?</strong> Of course we enjoy, good drink, good food and entertainment. But to us, a friendraiser is simple. If you're a friend and you help us raise funds or awareness, then you're a FriendRaiser. And since it's June Awareness Month (JAM), we've added new items to our Friendraiser store to help you on both fronts.

Shirts, caps, mugs... every item sold in the Friendraiser store sends a dollar the way of the Foundation to support its goals of raising awareness, supporting research, and MdDS patient advocacy. Please be a FriendRaiser today and shop at www.printfection.com/walk4mdds
