<p class="intro">Hello, could someone out there please fix me?</p>
I never asked for or deserved this illness you see
Nothing is wrong, so it may appear
But each sun rise becomes another day of fear
Wake me up from this bad dream, how can this possibly be?

This might be hard for you to understand
I used to be the one lending the helping hand
Now I lay in bed everyday
Reminiscing the days, I used to play
Refusing to accept, as many would say, ‚Äúthis is god‚Äôs plan‚Äù

Test after test, diagnosis after diagnosis, can anyone help me please?
We‚Äôre sorry, what you have is a rare disease
As of now it is unknown to medicine
In a matter of time you may end up bed ridden
Overwhelmed with disbelief, uncontrollably crashing to my knees

I may be a child or have many children of my own
This sickness is not prejudiced, it has shown
My family‚Äôs love gives strength to push through
Though somedays the simplest things I cannot do
I pray this rare disease never intrudes, breaking your beautiful home

I know I‚Äôm not alone, others out there are suffering too
In the whole world we are still considered a few
Together we all want to fight
We need help to get the data right
I would do anything to never again walk in these unstable shoes

I know there is special people out there that could put a termination to this
Crushing this rare disease for the ones suffering and creating a life of bliss
What I can do is unknown
Hoping you can hear my desperate tone
I pray every night my struggles will end, in reality progress is my one and only wish
