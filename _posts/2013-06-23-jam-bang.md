It's been a very busy and active June Awareness Month (JAM). Over 500 professional brochures have been mailed <em>around the world</em> in efforts to educate the public and professionals about Mal de Débarquement Syndrome. Many people are doing once-a-day informational posts on their Facebook pages, and others are donating to keep the efforts alive. We'd like to extend a very sincere thanks to all who have contributed to this MdDS Foundation awareness and fund-raising campaign.

Donations will support much-needed MdDS research. So far, we have received $260 towards the $500 matching challenge. The June 29 deadline for this challenge is quickly approaching. However, new pledges have now been promised! If we match an additional $1,000 by July 6, we can easily turn $1,500 into $3,000. Your help is vital... no amount is too small and all contributions will make a difference. <strong>Together we can meet this challenge</strong>.

Donations can be processed <a title="Donate Using PayPal" href="https://mddsfoundation.org/donate" target="_blank" rel="noopener">electronically on our website</a> or by check payment sent to:
