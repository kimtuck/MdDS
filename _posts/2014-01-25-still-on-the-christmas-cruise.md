I went on a 7-day Christmas cruise, which ended on December 31, 2011. I felt the bobbing as soon as I got off the ship, and thought it would go away in a few hours as I adjusted to being back on land. I had to take a flight back home immediately after getting off the ship. The bobbing feeling, like I was still on the ship, never left me.

I suffered for several weeks, not knowing what was wrong and then went to my family doctor and had a physical in February 2012. Everything was fine except for some anemia and low Vitamin D level. For lack of a better term, I told her about the "dizziness," as I had no reference to describe my symptoms. She recommended physical therapy.

In March 2012, as my symptoms were not getting any better, she had me undergo an MRI, and could not find anything that would cause my symptoms. She then sent me to an ENT. My hearing was tested and all was normal and he could not find anything wrong. I described my symptoms then as “as if I were rocking and still on the boat”. I told him I was perfectly fine till I got off the cruise ship. He sent a note to my family doctor suggesting it might be MdDS and mentioned it to me. I looked up the syndrome, and was totally shocked to find that the symptoms of MdDS pretty much described my symptoms exactly.

Supposedly this should go away eventually, but mine did not, so I went back to my family doctor in April 2012. I was so very tired, with the same symptoms of bobbing, also some migraines, more ear fullness, tinnitus, and difficulty concentrating. She diagnosed me with MdDS and put me on Clonazepam. It really helped bring the bobbing down somewhat and made me feel much better. After only a few weeks or so, I started feeling very drowsy with the Clonazepam, so I slowly stopped taking it. Since August 1, 2012, I have not taken any medications other than vitamins and supplements, aspirin, and ibuprofen.

In October 2012, I was very fortunate to be able to participate in Dr. Dai’s research on the treatment of MdDS at Mt. Sinai in NYC. His treatment made a huge difference in my symptoms. I felt “grounded” for the first time since getting off the ship. I was brought down to levels 1-2 after Dr. Dai’s treatment, and I give credit for getting me on the right path to remission. He really helped so much! I have been making gradual improvement since then, and now just have the floaty head feeling on some days. I try to get a good night’s sleep and to not stress. Now my symptoms are very low, and I am feeling 99% better!! — But I will NEVER cruise again!
