GivingTuesday 2017 was the MdDS Foundation’s <em>most successful one-day fundraiser ever</em> with help from Facebook and the Gates Foundation. Due to the tremendous engagement and enthusiasm by the nonprofit community, the $2 million match limit was reached early and a total of $45 million was raised on Facebook for many worthwhile causes.

Fourteen of our MdDS warriors set up individual fundraising pages along with the Foundation’s community page and raised $7,083 in fee-free donations on November 28. The Foundation will receive $525 of matching funds for a one day total of $7,608. These fundraisers helped bring in donations by check and PayPal as well, with a record breaking total of $15,000 plus in donations for November. With donations still coming in, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pg/mddsfoundation.org/fundraisers/">Facebook will waive fees through year-end</a> and these numbers will increase even more.

As 2017 comes to a close, we wish to show our appreciation for our supporters whether they be MdDS Warriors, or their friends and family. Since the Foundation is an all-volunteer nonprofit with 96% of donations going directly to research and awareness efforts, your support makes a huge difference for those suffering with MdDS.

Sincere thanks,
<em>Terri Gibson, Treasurer</em>
