<strong>We're kicking off our biggest fundraiser of the year with a $1,000 donation!</strong> To be precise, $1,365 thanks to Julie Lipp. While Julie raised these funds amongst her family and friends — HUGE THANKS TO ALL OF YOU — the MdDS Foundation is joining other nonprofits in a Giving Tuesday celebration on Razoo. Razoo is the platform we used last year to raise almost $10,000 <em>in one day</em>. With your help again, we can raise even more this year. <strong>$40,000 is needed to sustain MdDS research for one more year,</strong> so let's get fundraising!

<strong>Two Ways You Can Help</strong>

<img class="alignleft wp-image-3844 size-thumbnail" src="https://beta.mddsfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/mdds-turkey.png?w=141" alt="mdds-turkey" width="141" height="150" />The easiest way is simply make a donation <a href="https://www.razoo.com/us/story/Rocking-Our-Way-To-40k-1">on our Razoo page</a>. If you celebrate Thanksgiving in the US, the suggested donation is the price of your Thanksgiving day turkey. But why not get together with friends and family to "Dine &amp; Donate"? Use the Support Groups to find MdDS friends near you and celebrate #GivingTuesday over a meal. Then each participant matches the cost of their meal cost as a donation. Feel free to Dine for MdDS early, as this fundraiser ends on 11/30.

Starting mid-November, each donation made in advance and scheduled for Giving Tuesday will make the Foundation eligible to win cash prizes. Details will be announced as soon as available. What we know now is:<!--more-->
<ul>
 	<li>Individuals setting up their own fundraiser page <em>now</em>, to support our charitable cause, is a sure way to help us reach our goal — visit our page to see the goal meter rise.</li>
 	<li>Each fundraiser that shares on Facebook using the hashtag #razoopromo will increase our chances to win. (Last year we won around $700.)</li>
</ul>
<strong>Won't you please join us this Giving Tuesday</strong> and help us with our mission to find a cure for MdDS?
