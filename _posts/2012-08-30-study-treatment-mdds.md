If the answer is YES, you may be eligible to participate in a study of MdDS.

The goal of the study is to investigate the effectiveness of a behavioral treatment of MdDS. Your postural stability and personal feelings about the rocking sensation will be evaluated before and after treatment. The typical study duration is 1.5 hours for one day and will be followed by email or phone for up to 2 months. However, you may be asked to come back for a maximum 4 visits in 4 days. Some participants may experience improvement after the treatment. Monetary compensation will be provided for effort and time.

The study includes all ages and will be conducted in The Human Balance Laboratory of Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York City. Details and contact information are available in <a title="Mt.
