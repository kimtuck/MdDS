The Foundation uses two simple yet effective tools to advocate for you, on your behalf. Upon your request Board President, Marilyn Josselyn, herself will mail out a letter to your doctor that introduces them to MdDS. This one page letter briefly describes MdDS, possible etiology and current research efforts.

The second tool is our educational brochure. To supply his/her practice with brochures, simply send us your doctor's name and address, and we'll send them along with a Letter for Professionals. If your appointment is very soon, you may download and print the brochure by clicking on the thumbnail image below.

We know it seems very early, but these are great to have for June Awareness Month. Send your request today to <a href="mailto://brochures@mddsfoundation.org">brochures@mddsfoundation.org</a>.

While we are happy to provide these tools and services for you, it costs about $25 to produce and send 35 informational brochures to a healthcare provider. A donation in any amount will help offset the cost. Thank you in advance.
