With the help of some great volunteers, there is now an MdDS awareness bracelet! It's been an interesting learning experience, but the design, production and US shipping hurdles have all been figured out, and we are now ready to roll them out to the public!*

To receive a <strong>Stop the Rock!</strong> bracelet, simply make a donation of $20 or more using the button below, and we'll send a bracelet — while supplies last — to the mailing address associated with your PayPal payment. You'll also receive our recently updated brochure, which is a great awareness-raising tool that you can share with your doctor.
