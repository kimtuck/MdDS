Along with several annual donors, since 2009 a small group of people have unknowingly become a team of rare champions. These friends and family members have continually shown their support of the MdDS community and their commitment to our mission and goals. They've proven that small donations over time are just as impactful as any large one-time donation, and together they have raised more than $6,000.
<h2>Thank you for being Donor All-Stars.</h2>

<h3>Are You Ready to be a Donor All-Star, too?</h3>
The updated website was well-received by medical professionals, and now we could really use help covering the cost to update, print and deliver new brochures to them: $3,000. Please schedule a recurring donation today using the button on the right side of <a href="http://mddsfoundation.org/donate/">this page</a>.
<h4>You can make a real difference.</h4>
The Foundation thanks another All-Star, George Alvarado, for volunteering to handle brochure requests. George is on active duty in the Air Force and after more than a year of dedication to the MdDS community, it is time to give him a break from volunteer service. If you are interested in volunteering to mail out brochures, please <a href="mailto:mddsfoundation@yahoo.com">contact us</a>! We'll provide you with brochures and details.

<small>UPDATE: Thank you for responding so enthusiastically to volunteer. Our brochure needs are filled. For other volunteer opportunities, see our <a href="https://mddsfoundation.org/volunteer-mdds-foundation/">Volunteering</a> page.</small>
