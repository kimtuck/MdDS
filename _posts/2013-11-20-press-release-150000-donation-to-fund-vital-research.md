<b>Donation to Fund Vital Research into Mal de Debarquement Syndrome</b>

<em>Shannondell, PA – November 20, 2013</em> – The MdDS Balance Disorder Foundation is pleased to announce that it has received a $150,000 donation from Ellen Kaye to fund vital research into the cause of and a cure for Mal de Débarquement Syndrome. This donation, along with funds generated by direct donations to the Foundation, will support ongoing research efforts to provide relief for those living with Mal de Débarquement Syndrome, a rare disorder of motion perception in which sufferers feel rocking, bobbing, sensation that is masked by passive motion. Although it occurs most often after any means of travel including cruise ships, plane flights, and train travel, it can also occur seemingly spontaneously.

In the past 5 years, the Foundation has raised close to $500,000 to support research efforts such as those at the University of California at Los Angeles, Ohio University, and the Laureate Institute for Brain Research. As a result of this research, current medical information about this rare disorder is being generated, and several articles have been accepted as peer-reviewed publications for distribution to medical professionals and the public.
