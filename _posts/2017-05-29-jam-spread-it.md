Did you know that June is our Awareness Month? Well, now you do and we'd like you to join us this JAM. MdDS Foundation informational <a href="http://www.mddsfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/MdDS-Brochure-rev2014.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">brochures</a> are a great way to spread the word and educate others about MdDS. To receive free brochures, send an email with your complete mailing address and quantity needed to brochures@mddsfoundation.org.

Since JAM 2016, volunteers have mailed out over 750Â brochures to addresses in the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia. With a large mailing on the booksÂ for medical professionals in those countries plus South Africa, we're needing to print new brochures!

If you'd like to make a donation to help offset theÂ cost of printing andÂ postage, please remember that the <a href="https://www.paypal.com/fundraiser/105865137050618816/charity/23117" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GivingFund</a> is a fee-free way to send your gift to the Foundation.

From the bottom of our JAM jars, THANK YOU!
