February 29, 2012 â€“ Sitting in a business meeting, I casually mentioned that it was Rare Disease Day and a woman raised her hand proudly and said, "I have a rare disease!" I shouldn't have been surprised, but I was.

Having an orphan disease like MdDS, we so often feel isolated, and it seems like there's no one out there that understands. But <strong>MdDS is just one of more than 7,000 rare diseases that, collectively, affect 1-in-10 Americans</strong>.

Whether sitting together over a cup of coffee or chatting on FaceBook, taking action on Rare Disease Day removes that isolation and unites us in solidarity. Don't fret if you weren't able to get a Governor's Proclamation. It took me two years to get one. Just remember, "<strong>Alone We Are Rare, Together We Are Strong</strong>."

Here are this year's Visions of Solidarity.
