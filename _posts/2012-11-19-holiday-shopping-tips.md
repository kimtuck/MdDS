<strong>With only 5 more weekends left to holiday shop</strong>, I'd like share some shopping tips with you that'll save you from having to get up at 4 am or earlier! Not only will you get to stay in bed, you'll get both great deals and generate funds for the Foundation.

<strong>First, the great deals</strong>. My favorite way to shop is with coupons, even when I'm shopping online. Never shop without looking for a coupon code at Retailmenot.com. If a coupon code exists, they'll have it. In the example below, I've entered printfection.com, which happens to be where the Foundation houses its Friendraiser store. There aren't any discounts to be had on our We Rock t-shirts and mugs at the moment, but we're working on something special for you. Keep watching this blog for the announcement. Meanwhile, be sure to bookmark the site or download the RetailMeNot app for savings up to 65% off!<a href="http://www.retailmenot.com/"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1957" title="RetailMeNot" src="http://mddsfoundation.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/retailmenotexample.png" alt="" width="640" height="70" /></a>
<strong>Now for the fundraising</strong>. In the US, the Foundation is listed with <a href="http://www.iGive.com/mddsfoundation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">iGive.com</a>, which we've <a href="https://mddsfoundation.wordpress.com/2012/04/06/the-silver-lining-in-my-hot-water-tank/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">written about before</a>. The short story is iGive sends donations made by retailers on your behalf. There are thousands of stores that will make a donation to the Foundation, and all you have to do is register with iGive and shop online as usual. You can use your Facebook login to register so it's super easy. You won't pay higher prices and iGive tells you how much they'll be donating - drugstore.com for example will donate 4.8% - so you can feel good while you shop.

Here again, just register then shop online as usual. One of our UK members tells us some of the big retailers there are John Lewis, M &amp; S, Amazon, Tesco, Debenhams and Argos.

<strong>Now for the best of both</strong>! Register for either of the fundraising sites, then look for a coupon code on retailmenot. You just might be able to save a few bucks (or pounds) <em>and</em> send some the Foundation's way to further awareness and research efforts. How awesome is that?

We hope you have a great time shopping with these tips, and <strong>we wish you a very Happy Thanksgiving.</strong>
