<h2>Challenge #1: <strong>$7 Million Match on Facebook</strong></h2>
<strong>Starting at 5am PST/8am EST</strong>Â donations to nonprofits on Facebook, like the MdDS Foundation, will be matched until $7 million in Facebook matching funds are dispersed. Just donate through our special <a href="https://www.facebook.com/donate/461437724380738/">Matching Challenges fundraiserÂ page</a> or any donate button on our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/mddsfoundation.org/">Page</a>. With over 1 million nonprofits on Facebook vying for the funds, last year's GivingTuesday match was met in under 30 minutes. <em>Please add this event to your calendar and set an alert</em>.

To those of you gathering together on Thursday, we hope you have a wonderful Thanksgiving surrounded by friends and family. If you are shopping deals on Black Friday and Cyber Monday, we hope you stay out of the fray and have stress-reducing tip for you: <strong>Start with a Smile</strong>. When you shop through Amazon's charity portal, <a href="http://smile.amazon.com/ch/20-5953110">smile.amazon.com</a>, they make donations to the Foundation. We hope you'll set aside some of the money you save for the matching challenges.Â <strong>Thank you for supporting MdDS research and awareness efforts, and helping MdDS warriors get their lives back.</strong>

<small>One final note: Thanks to a partnership with PayPal,Â all donations made throughÂ FacebookÂ are fee-free.Â ðŸ˜Š</small>
