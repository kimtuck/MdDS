Now you can finally get these items at our new Friendraiser Store!

With June Awareness Month (JAM) right around the corner, now is a great time to order. There are two mug designs and two t-shirt designs, including a reprint of the official walk-a-thon t-shirt IN COLORS, not just white!

And for the ladies, say goodbye to the baggy t-shirts! We've got women's fit, too. Finally, with every shirt or mug sold $1 will be donated to the Foundation.

When people see our unique logo, they're sure to ask what it's for. Please help raise awareness for your MdDS friends next month and wear a We Rock!! t- shirt. Here is the link: http://www.printfection.com/walk4mdds
