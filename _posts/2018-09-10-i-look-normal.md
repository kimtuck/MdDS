I wrote this poem a number of years ago (maybe 5 years ago) and I sometimes post it as a status update. My daughter is no longer a toddler but the rest holds true. ~ Tami Grosset
<h3>I look normal.</h3>
I sit in my chair and chat.
I giggle and gossip just like I've always done.
<h4>I look normal.</h4>
I hold my daughter’s hand as we walk down the street.
I wave to my neighbours brightly saying hello.
<h4>I look normal.</h4>
I push the cart around the grocery store.
I pick out my family's favourite goodies and pay at the cash, just like anyone else.
<h4>I look normal.</h4>
But look a little closer and
You will see that
As I chitter chat I keep my head straight
And stop it from inclining towards you which would send my mind in a
Spinning spitter spatter.
As I giggle and gossip I grip the arms of my chair tightly
Because I'm afraid I might tip off.
<h4>You will see that</h4>
As I walk down the street I hold my daughter away from me so her tiny toddler legs don't trip me up
And I hold out my spare hand as if I am walking along a trampoline
Rather than the solid cement surface of the sidewalk.
<h4>You will see that</h4>
As I reach each aisle in the store I stop
And breathe
And check my list again
As I try to reach through the fog to find the memory of what I'm cooking this week and which cereal my kids like the best.
And as I find my purse to pay I fumble and drop my card on the floor.
Every single time.
<h4>I look normal</h4>
But I'm not.
Look a little closer
<h4>And you'll see.</h4>
