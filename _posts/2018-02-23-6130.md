<img class="alignleft wp-image-6131 size-medium" src="https://mddsfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/IMG_0094-e1516302661476-212x300.jpg" alt="Elizabeth Taylor Greenwood" width="212" height="300" />In September 2017, my husband, my two sons (ages 20 and 21) and myself went on our first cruise, two weeks before the canaries Portugal Spain. All was well on the cruise, none of us were sea sick, but we did have rough days around the bay of biscay.

On return home, my two sons had no adverse affects at all from the cruise, my husband was wobbly for a week, myself however was wobbly from debarkation till today, which is 111 days later!!

I went to see my doctor after 2 weeks – was told I had Labyrinthitis, even though I told him about the cruise, and that I felt like I was still on the ship, swaying unbalanced fullness in ears, etc. Doc prescribed anti nausea meds — lol I wasn't feeling nauseous — and nasal spray, hence 2 weeks later I am back at the docs, saying I am going crazy, crying , feeling depressed. Next doc prescribed something for people with Ménière's; this did nothing for me either. I then went to see a chiropractor as I thought he might be able to help. He ruled out a few things by doing rotary test, hall pike manoeuvre, and other tests. I kept searching the Internet by using my symptoms as a guide,
<h4>Why do I feel like I am on a boat? Voila MdDS.</h4>
I ended up back at my doc, saw an ent doc at hospital, and showed her my notes. She agreed with me about mdds, so now I have just had a MRI, to check my inner ear, I take prozac, also I have gone back on my hrt medication, my symptoms have subsided slightly, I don't rock , leg gravity is not as bad all the time, light and sound sensitivity is bad, I am hoping I will be one of the lucky ones, who will go into remission, and never get mdds again, this is what we all want. I for one will never go on a cruise again, this syndrome tears families apart

I am lucky to have a very loving supportive husband and sons, I have had to stop working as a childminder, I have also been in touch with royal Caribbean cruises about my mdds, needless to say they have not replied to my email.
