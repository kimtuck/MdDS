<p style="text-align: center;">Laureate Institute for Brain Research Study
Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation for Mal de Débarquement Syndrome</p>
A Laureate Institute for Brain Research (LIBR) research study is investigating the use of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) for the treatment of Mal de Débarquement Syndrome (MdDS), a balance disorder characterized by chronic rocking dizziness which usually follows prolonged exposure to passive motion such as on a boat, airplane, or car. Some people may develop the disorder spontaneously. The study is recruiting patients with MdDS ages 18 years and older. TMS is a noninvasive form of brain stimulation using a magnetic coil.

Eligibility includes:
* No metal implanted, except for dental fillings
* No serious medical illness
* Not taking tricyclic antidepressant or antipsychotic medications
* No personal or family history of a seizure disorder
* Not pregnant

Participation will require undergoing a brief screening interview over the telephone to assess safety for TMS. If qualified to enter the study, study procedures will include 1-3 MRI scans and 2 to 20 sessions of TMS performed at the Laureate. Qualification for participation in each part of the study will be determined by the investigator.

Compensation at $25 an hour is offered for all components of the study.
