<em><strong>Please leave a comment to congratulate and thank Hayley</strong></em>, for carrying the banner 21.1 kilometers or 13.1 miles, in her run to raise awareness of MdDS.

Hayley completed the half-marathon in her MdDS shirt and raised over $1,300 for research. She ran in honor of Jane, the UK representative for the MdDS Foundation. Not only does Jane manage all the UK help requests, she also operates the website for those with MdDS in the UK, <a href="http://www.mdds.org.uk">www.mdds.org.uk</a>.
