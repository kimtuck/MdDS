<a href="http://www.rarediseaseday.org/"><img class="alignleft" title="Rare Disease Day logo" src="http://img.rarediseaseday.org/RDD_2011/downloads/RDD_white_lg.jpg" alt="" width="122" height="117" /></a> By definition, a rare disease affects a small segment of the population, yet combined the 7,000 known rare diseases affect 30 million people — that's 1 in 10 of us. Many Americans do not realize how common rare diseases are and that our community has tremendous unmet medical needs. On February 29, join together to raise your voice and make the voice of rare diseases heard.

A request to declare February 29, 2016 as Rare Disease Day has already been submitted to Colorado's Governor. We ask that you raise your voice and do the same for your state — all it takes it one person per state. Getting your governor's proclamation is important because it raises awareness about orphan disorders like ours. It is very easy, but here are some tips to make it even easier.

1) Below is a select list of governor's web sites. If your state is not listed, use Google or <a title="GoodSearch" href="http://www.goodsearch.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GoodSearch</a> to find your state governor's web site. There you will find the mailing address and contact numbers. This is the best way to submit a formal request. <a title="Rare Disease Day Proclamation Request" href="http://mddsfoundation.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/rdd-governor-letter-2012.doc">Here is a downloadable letter that you can customize and mail</a>.

2) On the "Contact the Governor" web page, search for a "Proclamations" link where you can submit your request online. They probably will not let you submit the letter but may ask for this information instead:
<ul>

<strong>Rare Disease Day</strong> was first observed in Europe in 2008. It was established by <a href="http://eurordis.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EURORDIS</a>, the European Rare Disease Organization. In 2009, EURORDIS asked <a href="http://rarediseases.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NORD</a> to be its partner in this initiative and to sponsor Rare Disease Day in the United States. Now, the concept is rippling out around the world. In 2011, over 60 countries participated.
Each year, World Rare Disease Day will be observed on the last day of February (Feb. 29 in leap years and Feb. 28 in other years). Our goal is to draw attention to rare diseases as an important public health issue that cannot be ignored.
