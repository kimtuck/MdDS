In the spirit of Giving Tuesday, the MdDS Balance Disorder Foundation would like to share some important news. Over the next year, the MdDS Foundation will be the beneficiary of a directed donation, in the amount of $100,000, with the sole purpose of increasing awareness of MdDS in the medical community and the general population. Working with a professional public relations firm, the foundation, along with the donor, will be positioned to develop tools needed for these educational efforts while improving social media presence. This sizable donation is greatly appreciated. More information will be shared as it develops.

Please continue to support the current #GivingTuesday fundraiser to keep research moving forward. Not only will the non-profit with the most dollars raised when #GivingTuesday starts win a $500 prize, we also have a $20,000 Matching Challenge that can double your donation. The match must be met by the close of Giving Tuesday. It's a 24-hour global day of giving.
