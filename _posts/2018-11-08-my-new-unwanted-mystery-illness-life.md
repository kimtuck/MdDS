For our 25th anniversary, my husband and I went on my dream vacation with our 2 best friend couples. We got scuba certified for the trip and spent 9 months preparing for this trip. I counted the days I was so excited! Who knew that I was counting my last days of being normal? We boarded the ship on a Sunday, and on Tuesday we had our first excursion off the ship. One of my friends remembers me saying, from the minute we stepped onto land that I was rocking and swaying. Of course, I don’t remember this. I have such brain fog and memory loss, I don’t remember lots of things anymore. I do remember that on day 4 of the cruise I had such a stiff neck and my shoulders were drawing up to my ears. I thought why in the world would I be so tense and uptight when I’m on such a relaxing vacation and having so much fun?!

Fast forward to the end of our cruise when we disembarked. We all had sea legs and kind of laughed it off. One by one everyone got back to normal except me. Days went by then weeks went by. I was rocking, bobbing, trampoline walking, my neck was getting so stiff that I could barely turn it left or right. Depression was setting in, and I have never suffered from it before. I was also suffering from migraines and never had them before either. After a few weeks, I knew something wasn’t right.

I am an office manager for a doctor. He and I started Googling my symptoms and found MdDS. I went to my primary care doctor, and of course he didn’t know what this was. Then I went to an ENT that had to Google in front of me what MdDS was, but didn’t know what to do for me. I went to a neurologist that treated me like it was all in my head and said there was no way I had MdDS. The doctor I work for then found <a href="https://mddsfoundation.org/research/">Dr. Dai</a> online and emailed him personally regarding my condition. Dr. Dai responded within a hour.
<h4>I remember being so excited and thinking this is it this is my cure!</h4>
I filled out the paperwork and was scheduled for treatment 6 weeks out. I went to Mount Sinai for treatment, but unfortunately it did not help me. So I came back home and tried to deal with this mysterious beast and work and live a normal life. I became very depressed, and of course all that doctors do is put us on antidepressants and benzos. Barely functioning, I found a female neurologist that I liked and that listened to me and worked with me to find meds that would work for me. But it seemed we would find something that would work for a little while, then I would slip back into a dark place.

I have to admit that I have had some suicidal moments (never in my life until getting MdDs have I had these moments). Because I have such brain fog I have had to look back at posts on Facebook in the MdDS groups I’m in, and I can see a pattern of a good 6-8 weeks and then a bad 4-6 weeks. I think it’s just hard to fight this beast for too long of a time, and it just gets to me. My job is very demanding, and stress is always a factor that overwhelms me. I have made it 2½ years but fear every day that with my brain fog and memory issues I will not be able to hold onto my job. I remember one day listening to my staff talking about life and weekend plans, grand babies and whatnot, and all I could think was I wanted to die! That I had nothing to look forward to because of this damn syndrome.

Throughout this journey, I have always stayed at a <a href="https://mddsfoundation.org/symptoms/#symptom-severity-scale">6-9</a> with my symptoms, and I just had the worst summer. I used to run, kayak, scuba dive, swim, do all kind of DIY projects, gardening… you name it. I was a very active person. The medications I take help me function only somewhat. They haven't helped my rocking, bobbing, or trampoline walk, and this summer I did nothing. I felt like I was going to lose my mind, my symptoms were so bad. I really did just want to give up and die at one point. Were it not for my husband and two sons, I probably would have. My husband has been so great and has stepped up and has taken such great care of me, our family and home. I thought that this was my life now and that I was just going to exist, although barely. Out of pure desperation, I tried CBD oil without THC in it.
<h4>I have gotten my life back.</h4>
I have gone down to a 1-2 and even have days that I had no symptoms. I’m hopeful that I might achieve remission on these drops! I want to bring awareness to this awful syndrome and, yes, we need more testing and treatments being done, but I also think that we need to be open to all kinds of things out there. I have been open to many treatments that unfortunately haven’t worked for me and medications that just mask the real problem. In a 2-week period on CBD oil, I have had real results and have my life back. I think this should be shared with everyone as much as all of the other treatments, medical information and supplement information that is being done.

I hope my openness and story can shed light on what this syndrome does to someone and their lives. <em>~ Darla W.</em>
