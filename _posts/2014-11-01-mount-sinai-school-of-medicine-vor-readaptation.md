The following update is provided by Mingjia Dai, PhD., Mount Sinai School of Medicine.

<hr />

Oct. 30, 2014 — Since the <a href="http://journal.frontiersin.org/Journal/10.3389/fneur.2014.00124/abstract" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">publication</a> on the study of the treatment for patients with MdDS, we have further explored VOR Readaptation for patients with classic MdDS (17 patients), spontaneous MdDS (no clear cause, 9 patients) and “MdDS” from head trauma (2 patients). The success rate in this group for classic MdDS is 76% (13/17), compatible with the published data. The rate for spontaneous MdDS is 33% (3/9), and there was no effect on patients with head injury.

We deeply regret that current treatment costs are a financial burden for some patients but at present we have not secured funding to support the study. However, we are continuously improving our technology, developing a home exercise strategy and searching for the mechanisms responsible for spontaneous MdDS. We are confident that we can increase the success rate in the future.

We would like to thank the MdDS Balance Disorder Foundation and patients alike for their support and encouragement. MdDS is a rare, devastating and intractable devil, and we believe it will come to an end in the near future. For inquiries and appointment, please contact <a href="mailto:zelinette.lapaz@mssm.edu">Ms. Zelinette La Paz</a>.
