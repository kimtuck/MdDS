"A nurse has been left feeling permanently airsick - ever since she stepped off a turbulent flight six years ago.

Gill Archer, from Wolverhampton, West Midlands, was left struggling to balance, feeling queasy and permanently dizzy when she stepped off the long-haul flight to Florida in 2006.

The mother-of-three assumed the feeling would pass - but was horrified when her symptoms continued for weeks."

Gill's story was picked up by the Daily Mail, and the article has already helped someone who writes, "I finally know what is wrong with me!!! Thank you for bringing this to light."
