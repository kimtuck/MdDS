<h3>Rare Diseases Are Not Rare!</h3>
<p class="p1">1 in 10 Americans has a rare disease or disorder. Globally, the figure is 350 million. Rare diseases are not rare! Here are a few submissions by MdDS warriors to the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS)​ “Rare Diseases Are Not Rare!” competition, which challenged individuals to use social media or art to effectively communicate and educate people about rare diseases.</p>
<a href="http://bit.ly/thisismemdds"><strong>Hello This Is Me</strong>,</a> is an imploring poem by Crystal Beard that will leave you with lingering thoughts and imagery. It first appeared on the MdDS Foundation blog on Monday, November 12, 2018.

<a href="https://www.liferaftmdds.com/"><strong>Life Raft</strong></a>, a story-telling booklet by Kimberly Warner, offers an intimate and honest look at what it’s like to live with a rare, chronic disorder. Take the journey from discovery to building a life raft… filled with cats…by visiting Kimberley's website www.liferaftmdds.com.
