This year's Walk Series and Friendraiser was well-attended and contributed significantly to our efforts to fund MdDS education and research. Together, we raised over $7,500!

<strong>"Thank You!" to our sponsors, walkers, and cyberwalkers for making this event a success</strong>. Here are some pictures from Colorado, Texas, Massachusetts and Florida. If you've got Rock'n Stroll pictures you'd like to share here on the blog, <a href="mailto:mddswalk@yahoo.com">please send them to us</a>! We'd love to see them.
