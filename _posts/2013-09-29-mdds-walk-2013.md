We would like to invite you to the third annual MdDS Walk. This is a <em>global</em> awareness raising event for Rockers and non-Rockers alike. The physical walk in Colorado is a fun, family-friendly – and noncompetitive – event. Nicknamed the Rock'n Stroll, each year we leisurely rock and stroll down a path at a local park, chatting with friends along the way. This year we will have frozen yogurt and balloons to keep it fun and stress-free! The Denver walkers are meeting on Sunday, October 20 at Hope United Methodist on Dayton (just south of Belleview) in Greenwood Village, CO. Start time is 1:30 pm.

If you cannot be in Colorado for the walk, we encourage you to cyberwalk from any location. Also known as a "virtual walk," a cyberwalk opens up the MdDS Walk to everyone who isn't in Colorado. We have one Support Group member cyber­walking in the UK. Like the Denver group, she'll be Rock'n Strolling along a local "cycle path" and invites you to do the same.<small>

<span style="line-height: 1.5;">Cyberwalker</span><span style="line-height: 1.5;">s in other cities are invited to pick their own start time – or even date! Whatever works for you, works for us, because when we join together whether physically or in spirit, we can achieve so much. Last year, the MdDS Walk raised over $7,500 to fund education and research.</span>

<strong>Let's see how much we can raise this year</strong>. The MdDS Walk is also a critical fundraising event. Rather than using a registration site that charges us a fee, we are keeping it simple this year and ask that you simply bring a donation to the walk, or make a donation via our regular website at <a title="Donate" href="http://www.mddsfoundation.org/makeadonation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mddsfoundation.org</a>.
