The American Academy of Neurology (<a title="American Academy of Neurology" href="http://www.aan.com/go/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AAN</a>) has published a review article authored by Yoon-He Cha, MD, titled "Less common neuro-otologic disorders."

The review article describes four disorders, and includes a comprehensive clinical description of MdDS. It is written in very non-technical terms and is a good read for people unfamiliar with MdDS.

<i>Continuum: Lifelong Learning in Neurology<small>®</small></i> is the AAN's self-study continuing medical education publication. These type of review articles are widely read by practicing neurologists/neuro-otologists and residents in training, so Dr. Cha's article will be an important educational boost for MdDS.

The general public may view the abstract, and medical professionals may download the full article from the <a title="PubMed: Less Common Neuro-otologic Disorders, Cha, YH" href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23042064" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NIH National Library of Medicine's MEDLINE database</a>.
