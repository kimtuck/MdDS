"If something's confusing, just ask for help." That's the rule in my house. It's an aide for surviving MdDS. The only problem is, if your brain is foggy then you probably don't realize you're confused. That's how it came to be that I left the car running in a parking lot and walked a couple blocks away to another store. That was years ago and, while my motion symptoms have completely abated, the cognitive impairment lingers. I know I still need help.

So I'm asking. Will you help me beat MdDS?

If you've ever used the Foundation's website and found it helpful, you can do something today that will ensure it remains a valuable tool for others just discovering MdDS.

<h1>VOLUNTEER</h1>
The Foundation is actively recruiting volunteers to help update the list of doctors which is provided as a public resource on its website. Updating entails just two things:
<ul>
 	<li>contacting each practice to ensure they want to be included on the list</li>
 	<li>ensuring each listing is complete and accurate</li>
</ul>
This project is mostly just making phone calls or sending emails. Additional requirements are as follows:
<ul>
 	<li>Volunteer must be able to complete their assignment by <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">mid-May</span>. Deadline extended to end of June! Depending on how many sign-up to help, it may be as few as 10 or as many as 100.</li>
 	<li>Volunteer must be able to find missing information independently. Support Group members sometimes give recommendations without contact information. Brain fog?</li>
 	<li>Must be persistent and willing to make follow-up efforts.</li>
 	<li>Familiarity of Excel or other spreadsheet program is required.</li>
</ul>
The Foundation will provide access to a central database which volunteers will modify themselves. We'll also provide you with a pre-written message to use when contacting practices by email, and bullet points for phone calls. We regret that we won't be able to provide any compensation for expenses incurred, but we'd love to include your name and photo in a blog post declaring SUCCESS.

<strong>How can volunteering help beat MdDS?</strong> In addition to updating the list, we are working on an overhaul of the entire website. Our aim is to encourage medical professionals to stay on-site and learn about MdDS. Your volunteering can help ensure a high-quality list that doctors want to be included on, and a website that they find valuable. They stay, they learn, they help us. Make sense?

Please <a href="mailto:mddsfoundation@yahoo.com">contact us</a> if you're ready to volunteer. Monday is Go Day!
