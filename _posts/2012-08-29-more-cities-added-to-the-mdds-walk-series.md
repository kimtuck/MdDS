<small>AWARENESS WALK UPDATE:</small> Last week we added 8 pins to the Rock'n Stroll map, and we now have walkers and cyberwalkers in 3 countries. <strong>What exactly is a cyberwalker, you ask?</strong>
[googlemaps https://maps.google.com/maps/ms?msa=0&amp;msid=207449832681204037117.0004c4918b83bd2acbc0f&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;t=m&amp;ll=43.052834,-87.912598&amp;spn=4.013885,9.338379&amp;z=6&amp;output=embed&amp;w=425&amp;h=250]
At it's simplest, a cyberwalker is anyone who wants to support the walk series but isn't able to join one of our organized events. <span style="color: #800000;"><strong>To cyberwalk, all you do is <a title="Register to Cyberwalk" href="www.walk4mdds.eventsbot.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">register</a> and walk where ever you might be on the day of the Rock'n Stroll.</strong></span> Send us a picture of you walking to the fridge in your <a title="Purchase an official MdDS t-shirt" href="http://www.printfection.com/walk4mdds/2012-Rockn-Stroll-Economy-Version-unisex-fit/_p_7377264" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rock'n Stroll tee,</a> and we'll add it to our photo gallery of walkers. Even if you're not walking with a buddy that day, you'll see that you're not alone. <em>We're in this together.</em>

A cyberwalker can also be a person who wants to join a team in another city, without actually traveling. Just indicate which team you're cyberwalking for when you register online. Team Denver is lucky and has two cyberwalkers, both in Iowa! And I hate to break it to you, Team MA Walks for MdDS, but my sister and her family in Massachusetts is cyberwalking for Team Denver, too.

Teams that could use cyberwalker support include:
• Massachusetts Walks for MdDS - <a title="Register as a MA walker" href="http://www.eventsbot.com/events/eb074100091" target="_blank" rel="noopener">register for their Team</a> or <a title="MA Walks4MdDS fund-raising page" href="https://www.clickandact.com/pages/MAwalks/19274" target="_blank" rel="noopener">contribute on their Team fundraising page</a>.
• Wisconsin Walks for MdDS on 9/23, 1PM at Alterra on the Lake. <a title="Register as a WI walker" href="http://www.eventsbot.com/events/eb074100091" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Register for their Team</a> or <a title="Walk4MdDS fund-raising page" href="https://www.clickandact.com/pages/walk4MdDS/19274" target="_blank" rel="noopener">contribute on their Team fundraising page</a>.
• Art Bram in NY (<a title="Art Bram's fund-raising page" href="https://www.clickandact.com/Pages/MdDS%20Runner/19274" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here is his Team-of-One fundraising page</a>)

I am still working to wrangle up the Top Team Award, so stay tuned for news on that. Meanwhile <a title="New Rock'n Stroll walk details" href="http://www.eventsbot.com/events/eb074100091" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the latest details are up on the registration site</a> for both Art's half-marathon run and the H-Town Rockers' kick-off walk on September 15.

Please remember, whether you sign up as a cyberwalker or donate on the fundraising pages, your contribution is completely tax-deductible. We are all volunteers (and all MdDSers, too) so 96% of your donation will go straight toward education and research efforts. <strong>Thank you for your support</strong>.
