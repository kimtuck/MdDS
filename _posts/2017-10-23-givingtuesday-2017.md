<div style="padding: 12px; background-color: #f1f9fa; line-height: 1.4;"><strong><small>ANNOUNCEMENT</small></strong>: 10.27.2017 — The Gates Foundation is matching donations made to US nonprofits using <a href="https://www.facebook.com/mddsfoundation.org/">Facebook</a> on Giving Tuesday. Facebook is also waiving fees on donations that day, so please schedule a reminder for Giving Tuesday, 11/28/20017, on your calendar to donate through our fundraiser page on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/mddsfoundation.org/fundraisers">Facebook</a>.</div>

<hr />

<h2>This GivingTuesday, we are focused on our goal to help patients receive a quick and accurate diagnosis.</h2>
We're launching a direct mail campaign to raise MdDS awareness among medical practitioners, especially those who are in the early stages of their careers and looking for a specific direction to take. These young neurologists, otologists, neuro-otologist, audiologists, ENTs, and their academic professors will be receiving our updated informational brochure and educational at-a-glance card designed especially for them.

To accomplish our goal, we're holding a fundraiser through November 28, 2017 — <strong>GivingTuesday</strong>. If you're on Facebook, your donation can be matched by the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation. The match starts at 8am and ends at 5pm EST, and donations must be through the Donate button on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/mddsfoundation.org/">our Facebook page</a> or any of the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pg/mddsfoundation.org/fundraisers/">individual fundraisers</a> set up by members of the MdDS community.

Not on Facebook? Donations made by check or using the red button at the top of the page will still contribute to our mission and help #beatMdDS.

On behalf of the entire MdDS community, <strong>thank you</strong>.
