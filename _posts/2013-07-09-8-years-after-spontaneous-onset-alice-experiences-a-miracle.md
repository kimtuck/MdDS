In early 2005, I started having a "twitching" nerve at the base of my neck. Kaiser Hospital in Roseville, CA, gave me several tests. Yes... the doctors looked at me like I was crazy when I described my symptoms to them (ear "fullness", etc.) and were no help at all. A few months later we moved to the Houston, TX, area and I was diagnosed with TMJ which, after an expensive year of treatment, turned out not to be the problem. Saw a chiropractor, acupuncturist, you name it!

Finally went to a neurologist and he prescribed moist head massages and some exercises, plus a drug called Baclofen. After 8 sessions of this, I was barely able to walk! Ended up at the hospital for 4 days in Houston and was given Lyrica, Clonazepam, Mobic, and Fenofexidrine... ALL AT ONCE! Diagnosed with "Inflammation of the fifth nerve". When I got back home I was a ZOMBIE for about a year, sleeping all the time. Finally was able to stop all the drugs except Clonazepam.

Then I started feeling like I was "walking on a mattress". Looking back I think this must have been a reaction to all those drugs! To make a long story shorter, I have had 3 MRIs, seen an ENT (yes, all the awful tests). He sent me to a balance therapist, and I did all her tests with no problem. She said my balance was fine and told me about MdDS, but I hadn't been on a cruise for two years! She said in 14 years as a therapist, she'd never seen anyone like me. Since that time I just about gave up! <span style="line-height: 1.5;">I am now 80 years old and thought my next few years would be ruined from this MdDS thing.</span>

However, I learned about "spontaneous onset" on your site and realize I am not alone; not all MdDS is motion-triggered! I have lost about 7-8 lbs. recently, have been taking multivitamins, walking the dog around the neighborhood, and doing "leg-lifts", etc. <span style="line-height: 1.5;">I actually couldn't wear any of my old shoes and have been wearing bootie-type sox (the kind with little spongy circles on the bottom) in the house. That is, until I finally found some slip-on, stretchy canvas ones at Walmart. $10! They have a ballet-type sole, totally flat (they're called "<a title="Women's Lynley Canvas Slip-On at Walmart" href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CEsQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FWomen-s-Lynley-A-Line-Canvas-Slip-On%2F20679981&amp;ei=WmiNUcyOMMKmyQGt_oDYCw&amp;usg=AFQjCNHhlv1qlfYb-kw5YBz9wO1HWuU_EA&amp;sig2=BGWFLRm37ukfw0WxRcAJaA&amp;bvm=bv.46340616,d.aWc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lynley</a>"). </span>One morning the "mattress-walking" sensation was gone!!!! HAPPY DAY! I can actually balance on one foot now! I am still wearing sox around the house but shoes feel fine when I go out. After 8 years... It's like a miracle! Maybe it is the exercise and the "massaging" effect of those spongy dots on the sox that cured me. I have no other explanation to offer.
