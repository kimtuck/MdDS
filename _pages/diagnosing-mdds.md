<h2 class="intro">Mal de Débarquement Syndrome (MdDS) is a neurological disorder of perceived motion.</h2>
<ul>
 	<li>People with MdDS feel a rocking or swaying sensation. It is different from vertigo which causes spinning.</li>
 	<li>It is typically triggered by motion: cars, trains, airplanes, ships, boats, and even fast elevators. Virtual reality, water beds and even swimming on the surface of the water may cause it.</li>
 	<li>What makes MdDS truly different, is that symptoms often disappear when riding in a car or train—in passive motion.</li>
</ul>
<strong>MdDS requires no diagnostic tests.</strong> The answer to two questions determines the diagnosis:
<ol>
 	<li>Did you recently ride on a ship, boat, train or other transportation?</li>
 	<li>Do you still feel like you are rocking and swaying and the only time it stops is when you get back in a car, or boat or train?</li>
</ol>

<strong>Treatment Challenges:</strong>
<ul>
 	<li><span style="font-size: inherit;">There are many people walking around suffering from this condition who don’t know MdDS is the cause. They are undiagnosed.</span></li>
 	<li>The average person with this condition sees many doctors before getting a diagnosis and many tests with no answers.</li>
 	<li><span style="font-size: inherit;">Treatments are trial and error. Some medications may reduce symptoms, though they rarely stop the disorder completely.</span></li>
 	<li>MdDS may persist for months to years</li>
 	<li>The cause of MdDS remains unknown</li>
</ul>
