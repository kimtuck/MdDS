<p class="p1"><span style="font-size: inherit;">An </span><em style="font-size: inherit;">all-volunteer</em><span style="font-size: inherit;"> nonprofit foundation, we seek treatments and a cure for MdDS, a chronic neurological disorder causing the feeling of rocking and swaying, while assisting patients suffering from this life-altering disorder. We support research and studies that produce evidence-based findings.</span></p>

<h2>Mission Statement</h2>
The mission of the MdDS Foundation is to promote education and research on the neurological disorder, Mal de Débarquement Syndrome.
<h2>Goals</h2>
<ul>
 	<li>To facilitate <a href="http://mddsfoundation.org/clinical-studies/">clinical studies</a> designed to improve the diagnosis and treatment of MdDS,</li>
 	<li>To promote basic and <a title="Research Studies Seek to Understand MdDS" href="https://mddsfoundation.org/research/">clinical research</a> to better understand the cause of this unique syndrome,</li>
 	<li>To collect, collate, and distribute demographic and other information from those with MdDS <em>via</em> online <a title="Surveys" href="https://mddsfoundation.org/patient-surveys/">surveys</a> (at present, our findings represent the world’s largest available database about this patient population),</li>
 	<li>To update <a href="http://mddsfoundation.org/find-a-doctor">professionals</a> who provide medical care and treatment to MdDS patients,</li>
 	<li>To provide <a href="https://mddsfoundation.org/support/">support</a> and education for patients and families of those with this rare disorder.</li>
</ul>
Tax-deductible contributions are used to accomplish these goals only. The overhead cost to achieve our goals was less than 2% last year and is budgeted to remain at this level this year. The generosity of donors is absolutely vital as we steadfastly work toward these goals.
