The MdDS Foundation supports biomedical research that generates evidence-based data leading to knowledge regarding the cause, treatment, or prevention of Mal de Débarquement Syndrome (MdDS). This funding program recognizes the need for innovative research and scientific advances into these areas.

Applications for research support from qualified investigators are subjected to extramural review in a confidential process. Applications must be provided in the format of a NIH-style grant application (forms at: http://grants.nih.gov/grants/funding/phs398/phs398.html):

Protocols for research studies involving the use of human or animal subjects must be approved by an appropriate review board, e.g., institutional review board or institutional animal care and use committee.

The indirect costs or institutional overhead provided by the Foundation are limited to 10% for applications in excess of $30,000 direct costs and 0% if less than $30,000 direct costs. Grant funds may not be used for indirect costs or institutional overhead associated with the purchase of permanent equipment. Award funds are paid to the recipient’s institution or company in semi-annual payments over the term of the award. Continued funding is contingent upon submission of semi-annual progress and financial reports as well as confirmation that appropriate institutional approvals for human subjects and animal use are current and on file at the institution.

The MdDS Foundation makes awards to institutions, not individuals. Thus, the institution assumes all responsibilities for programmatic, administrative, and fiscal reporting as well local oversight to insure that all compliance and institutional assurances are met. Eligible applicants are: for-profit or non-profit organizations; public/State-controlled institutions of higher education; private institutions of higher education; units of State and local governments; domestic or foreign institutions/organizations.
