It may seem as if it is vertigo, but it isn’t. Vertigo patients spin. MdDS patients rock and sway. Vertigo comes in episodes. MdDS is 24/7. But what makes MdDS truly different, is that symptoms often disappear when riding in a car - in passive motion. It is typically triggered by motion: cars, trains, airplanes, ships, boats, and even fast elevators. Virtual reality, water beds and even swimming on the surface of the water may cause it.
