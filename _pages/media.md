<h3>What is disembarkation syndrome?</h3>
<small>Mal de Débarquement (French for “sickness of disembarkment") is known variably as disembarkment syndrome and disembarkation syndrome. The disembarkment/disembarkation is not limited to cruise ships and may in fact be from any vehicle, whether water, air or land-based.</small>
