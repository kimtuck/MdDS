<strong>The MdDS Balance Disorder Foundation takes the confidentiality of your information very seriously. At no time is this information made available to any other party without your express permission.</strong>

The MdDS Balance Disorder Foundation has created this privacy policy in order to demonstrate our commitment to privacy. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for our digital properties, which include this web site and our support groups.

The MdDS Foundation values and respects all individuals seeking information about Mal de Débarquement Syndrome or seeking to donate time, money, or resources to our non-profit projects. We understand that you may be concerned about privacy issues that surround the use of the Internet. We believe that you should have control over who receives your personal information, whether it concerns where you live, health information, what your interests are, or how you choose to conduct transactions.

We are focused on helping you in a secure environment. Therefore, we do not use or disclose information about your individual visits to the MdDS Foundation website, nor do we disclose information that you may give us, such as your name, address, e-mail address or telephone number, to any outside companies, except for the use of completing a transaction that you initiate.

You are free to browse without submitting any personal information (such as a name, address, IP address or e-mail address) when you visit the MdDS Foundation site. We do not collect any of your personal data unless you register for the MdDS Support Group, have registered to use one of our services, complete one of our evaluations, or otherwise agree to submit to us such information. As part of such processes, at any time, you have the opportunity to decline further communications, materials or other notifications.

<strong>Information About You</strong>
We will need certain information (such as your name, address, e-mail, billing information, etc.) when a donation or other transaction is involved. This information will be used solely for the purposes of completing your transaction. When you make a donation, you will have the opportunity to keep your personal information private by electing to donate anonymously. Your personal information is not shared with any outside companies or individuals without your direct knowledge and consent.

We use Free Online Surveys to conduct our <a href="https://mddsfoundation.org/patient-surveys/">Patient Surveys</a> for processing according to their <a href="https://shout.com/en/help/legal-and-gdpr/privacy-policy/" rel="nofollow">Privacy Policy</a> and <a href="https://shout.com/en/help/legal-and-gdpr/terms-and-conditions/" rel="nofollow">Terms of Service</a>.

This includes the tracking of page load times and resource loading duration (image files, Javascript files, CSS files, etc.). The site owner has the ability to force this feature <a href="https://jetpack.com/support/wordpress-com-stats/#honoring-dnt">to honor DNT settings of visitors</a>. By default, DNT is currently not honored.
