The Board of Directors of the MdDS Balance Disorder Foundation has approved the following policy regarding directed donations.

For annual gifts or grants of less than or equal to $4,999, monies cannot be directed/restricted in support of specific Foundation-sponsored activities. Requests of exception to this policy should be directed to the Board of Directors. Acceptance of directed donations for amounts of less than $4,999 in a given year will require formal action by the Board of Directors and will be considered only under exceptional circumstances*.

For annual gifts or grants of greater than or equal to $5,000, monies can be directed towards specific Foundation activities*. Acceptance of directed donations requires formal action by the Board of Directors.

<em><span class="small">*Please note that ALL donations are used to support the goals of the MdDS Foundation which include supporting MdDS research and furthering education about MdDS for medical professionals and the public. The Foundation discourages requests for designation of donations for specific purposes such as support for educational programs. Restricting the use of funds creates additional work for volunteers who maintain our fiscal records and increases the fees associated with the preparation of annual tax documents (which reduces the amount of the actual donation that would be available to support Foundation goals).</span></em>
