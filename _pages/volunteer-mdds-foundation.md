<h1 class="entry-title">From simply donating to our cause to hosting a fundraiser, there are many activities that you can do, and we can help.</h1>
<h3>4 Easy Ways to Help</h3>
<ol>
 	<li><strong>Use social media to spread the word</strong>. We post shareable content on <a href="http://twitter.com/mddsfoundation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/mddsfoundation.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Facebook</a>, <a href="http://www.instagram.com/mddsfoundation">Instagram</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCr7mf6wo9yDlP4r8dnh4KLQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouTube</a>. Tweet, RT, share and comment.</li>
 	<li><strong>Setup an <a href="http://www.igive.com/welcome/lp16/cr62a.cfm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">iGive.com</a> profile</strong> and iGive will make automatic donations on your behalf. All you need to do is set the MdDS Balance Disorder Foundation as your charity of choice and shop at affiliated online stores.</li>
 	<li><strong>Shop <a href="http://smile.amazon.com/ch/20-5953110" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AmazonSmile</a></strong> for an automatic 0.5% donation on eligible purchases to the charity of your choice. When logged in to both iGive and Amazon, the automatic donations get stacked.</li>
 	<li><strong>Shop</strong> the <a href="http://www.zazzle.com/mddsfoundation?rf=238617487973604920">MdDS Awareness Store</a> on Zazzle. A volunteer has designed t-shirts, hats, postage stamps and many other everyday items enabling you to raise awareness every day.</li>

<div style="padding: 12px; background-color: #2c5697; line-height: 1.4; color: white;">Work with other volunteers to <strong>update our Find a Doctor database</strong> and improve our website.</div>
<div style="padding: 12px; background-color: #f1f9fa; line-height: 1.4;">Inclusion in the <a href="http://mddsfoundation.org/find-a-doctor/">Find A Doctor</a> professional directory is strictly opt-in. The Foundation maintains a contacts database and entries need to be contacted to A) ensure a practice wishes to be included on our website and B) checked for accuracy.
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Volunteer requirements are as follows:</span>
• <strong>must be willing to make phone calls</strong>
• must be comfortable using a spreadsheet program such as Excel
• must be a self-starter, able to complete assignments independently and on a timely basis</div>

<div style="padding: 12px; background-color: #2c5697; line-height: 1.4; color: white;">We are currently seeking a <strong>an individual with a scientific or medical background</strong> to help customize our Patient Registry questionnaires.</div>
<div style="padding: 12px; background-color: #f1f9fa; line-height: 1.4;">The MdDS Foundation is actively developing a Patient Registry with Invitae to collect consistent information and establish accurate patient data. Collecting and storing data in one place benefits patients, researchers, and biopharmaceutical companies who are working to help find new and better treatments. <a href="http://bit.ly/MdDSpindata">The current PIN data</a> on Mal de Débarquement Syndrome skims the surface. Help us create questionnaires to collect the data that differentiates MdDS from common dizzy disorders and that medical professionals and researchers need.</div>
&nbsp;
<div style="padding: 12px; background-color: #2c5697; line-height: 1.4; color: white;">We are currently seeking <strong>Patient Ambassadors</strong>.</div>
<div style="padding: 12px; background-color: #f1f9fa; line-height: 1.4;"><strong>As a Patient Ambassador, you can add your voice to ours and help bring MdDS to the forefront</strong>. Patient Ambassadors are MdDS Warriors who are champions both in terms of surviving and thriving, and in terms of supporting our cause. We are looking for regular <a href="http://mddsfoundation.org/blog/">blog</a> or social media posts from a patient or caretaker perspective. The Patient Ambassador will contribute efforts to educate the general public, raise awareness, and garner support for our cause primarily through social media sharing. Directly contacting traditional media would be additionally helpful.</div>
&nbsp;
<div style="padding: 12px; background-color: #00a9cf; line-height: 1.4; color: white;">Are you super organized? We need a <strong>Project Manager</strong> to keep us on track to success.</div>
<div style="padding: 12px; background-color: #f1f9fa; line-height: 1.4;">The Project Manager will monitor all volunteer activity and ensure projects move forward. Typical projects include educational brochure, newsletter, awareness campaigns, and fundraising campaigns. With several projects going on simultaneously, efforts need to be coordinated within both our support groups and all our social media channels (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube).</div>
