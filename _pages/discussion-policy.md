We encourage your participation on our blog and social media pages, and hope that you will join the discussions. Please remember that when you post a comment to any blog or social media page, it may be published for the world to see. For your own privacy and that of your family, you should consider carefully how much detailed personal medical information linked to your name you want published on the Internet.

The MdDS Foundation does not discriminate based on race, gender or gender ID, sexual orientation or religious beliefs, and reserves the right to moderate comments to insure that they add value to the discussion of Mal de Débarquement Syndrome. So that everyone in our community has the best experience possible, please adhere to the guidelines and rules outlined below.
<h4>GUIDELINES</h4>
<ul>
 	<li>Comments should be brief (ideally under 150 words). Comments may be edited to limit scrolling. If they cannot be edited without altering the author’s intended meaning, they will not be published.</li>
 	<li>Comments must be relevant to the post title. Off-Topic comments may be deleted.</li>
 	<li>Only URL links to relevant news stories or sites are acceptable. Comments containing more than 2 links may be deleted. Comments containing 4 or more links will be marked as spam.</li>
 	<li>Do not include your email address or telephone number in your comment; they will be deleted.</li>
 	<li>Do not include medication dosages in your comment; they will be deleted.</li>
 	<li>Comment information is intended for informational purposes only and is not a substitute for professional advice.</li>
 	<li>Treat other commenters with respect, even if there is a disagreement; profanity and abusive language are out-of-bounds.</li>
